          <h3>Hi, I'm Banke Bihari Shukla</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating beautiful,
            responsive websites. With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            other modern technologies, I enjoy turning ideas into functional and
            aesthetically pleasing web applications. My goal is to create user-friendly
            experiences that meet both business and user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in front-end development but am always eager to learn and
            experiment with new technologies, including back-end development. I believe
            in continuous learning and growth, and Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges
            to expand my skill set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I love exploring new places, reading, and photography. If
            you'd like to collaborate or chat about any project, feel free to reach out to
            me through the contact form below!
